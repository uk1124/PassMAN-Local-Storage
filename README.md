PassMAN - Your Own Password Manager

PassMAN is a simple password manager built using React, TailWind CSS, MongoDB, and Express. It allows users to securely store their website URLs, usernames, and passwords in one place.

This project is same as `https://github.com/uk1124/PassMAN` but in this we are using local storage for storing the data instead of using MongoDB.
